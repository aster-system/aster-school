                    For my english class, I have to make a speech about whatever I want.
                    As an expert of quantum physic, I decided to talk about the danger that represents nukes.

                    The idea of the message is that the regulation of thoses weapons should be absolutely central in the UN security department.</br>
                    In a simple way, we can say "Nukes shoud be absolutely regulated".
